# plugin-segment-anything

A fully browser-based smart polygon selection tool for Annotorious based on the [sam2-hiera-tiny](https://huggingface.co/g-ronimo/sam2-tiny) SegmentAnything model. The basic approach is inspired by this [blog post](https://medium.com/@geronimo7/in-browser-image-segmentation-with-segment-anything-model-2-c72680170d92) and [demo code](https://github.com/geronimi73/next-sam).
